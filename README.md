#### bio
I have thought about this project for a long time but didn't have the skills/knowledge to know where to start, but now I do.
This project is free-flowing and my end goals might change over time.
# Main Focus
- Collecting data on soccer players
  - using python scrape fbref for player data 
  - names, country, positions, league, xg(expected goals) etc...
  - automate the web scraping, ie every day update stats  
- Creating a database to store the data
  -  MySQL database
  -  Create Rest API  
    - to be hosted on AWS
- Fronted to Display/Filter data for analysis
  - graphs, tables, in-form players
- Gen AI integration
  - Using dataset to train/fine-tune GPT or similar models for queries
    - Ex - What wingers create a lot of goals aka (shots created per 90 ) and are good at defending(interception/tackles per 90)?
     - Returns - Currently "Bukayo Saka" is the best of both worlds: Here are some other players that fit your request: player, player. player
